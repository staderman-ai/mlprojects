machine learning projects
These are some of the projects I have created. They give the reader a quick overview of my interests in machine learning. 

A quick description of the same:

1) tictactoe (Reinforcement Learning) - The Agent learns by playing against itself. It then plays against you. The agent becomes difficult to beat.
2) chatbot (NLP) - Uses bag-of-words and NN to select responses to give to user queries.
3) GAN (Computer Vision) - The generator and discriminator train on the MNIST dataset. Then when the generator is fed noise, it spits out a number. Different noise results in different numbers.
