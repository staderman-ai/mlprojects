This GAN uses the MNIST dataset to train a generator to create digits. Training was done on an Nvidia GPU.
Tensorflow and Keras were used to create the CNN and train the generator and discriminator.
After each training epoch the generator spits out the best image it can generate at that time. The user 
can see the improvements in the digits created by it at the end of every epoch.
