This Tic Tac Toe agent uses Reinforcement Learning to learn how to play the game. It plays against itself 10000 times and uses the Monte Carlo method. 

This program only uses the numpy python library and builds the agent from first principles.

There are several caveats in the program since it was only meant to demonstrate an application of reinforcement learning. Following are some of the caveats:
i) It does not have error checking of the moves made by the human player (an illegal move is currently not dealt with).
ii) Have not focused on the look and feel of the board and this needs improvement
iii) User has to play by entering row# col# ranging from 0 to 2. This is tedious.
